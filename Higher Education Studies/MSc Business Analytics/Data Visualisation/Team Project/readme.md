## Oculart Team Project

- The Interactive Visualisation directory contains the html/css/javascript files of the presentantion
- The Dataset directory keeps the link of the original dataset. This directory is where .zip files from Kaggle should be extracted (in order to execute directly the Jupyter notebbok)
- The MSIN0167\_VisualisationReport\_[OCULART] keeps the main report of our project
- The MSIN0167\_StaticPresentation\_[OCULART].pdf keeps the double A4 presentantion on a high quality format (300dpi)
- In the MSIN0167\_VisualisationDev\_[OCULART].ipynb you will find the development of most visualisations (except those which were developed in plotly javascript or D3.js)
