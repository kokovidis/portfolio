      <h3>
        You live for crunching data? Here’s what you need to know about the size
        of your team!
      </h3>

      <div>
        <p>
          There are two sides regarding the size of the Data Science teams.
          Small companies are great environment to share ideas, knowledge, be
          flexible and probably to have better working conditions. On the other
          hand, big teams may work with bigger projects and there is always the
          right person for a new task.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this analysis, offered to you by Oculart, you will know more about
          the differences between small and big data teams. For this purpose, we
          will review the latest Kaggle survey from 11743 professional who work
          with data. From this survey 5324 responders work in team of 2 to 4
          members and 6419 responders work to team of more than 4 members. The
          data were collected in 2019 from users all over the world.
        </p>

          Kaggle is a Data Science community where data experts can publish
          datasets and build machine learning models. It is also offer a
          platform to collaborate with others and solve Data Science challenges.

            <h3>Profile of responders</h3>
            <p>
              In this analysis we explore data experts who are currently
              employed (we excluded students). The total number of responders is
              11743, and they come from 57 countries. In summary, they answered
              34 questions which covered several aspects of their working
              environment (size of data team, size of the company, skillset that
              they use), their compensation, as well other personal
              characteristics (gender, academic background, years of
              experience).

            <h3>Educational Level</h3>
            <p>
              <br />
              It is true that data teams may come with people from different
              academic backgrounds. Nowadays, the variety of Massive Open Online
              Courses (MooC) allows anyone to gain data analytical skills
              without the need to pursue postgraduate (and probably expensive)
              studies. From our analysis it seems that still the majority of
              data professionals have at least a master degree. However, there
              is no great difference in educational level across small and large
              teams.

            <h3>Company Size</h3>
            <p>
              <br />
              Does the size of a company relate with the size of a data team?
              Nowadays, more companies trying to exploit the potentials of their
              data, however not all of the companies have sufficiently large
              data teams. This heatmap explores the size of data teams for
              different size of companies. What is interesting is that large
              data teams may exist also in small teams (probably the most
              data-oriented ones). On the contrary, we can still find big
              companies with relatively small data teams (less than 4 people).
              In the second case, probably the companies are still developing
              their data teams, or their industry cannot rely to a large extend
              on data-driven decisions.

            <h3>Gender</h3>
            <p>
              Before we start our exploration, we can have a look in the sex of
              the responders in different size of teams. In large teams, 84% of
              responders are male were only 16% of them are female. Small data
              teams have a very similar gender distribution. It is interesting
              to notice that in both cases, data-related roles are dominated by
              males. Hopefully, with the wide support of women in STEM, there
              will be more females working in data companies in the nearest
              future.

            <h3>Gender Pay Gap</h3>
            <p>
              Gender pay gap is now a hot topic. It is widely acknowledged that
              gender pay gap exists in many industries, so how about data
              related roles? As we can see in the plot, female data specialists
              tend to have a lower salary compared to male in both team size
              groups; however, this distance gets wider for respondents in large
              groups. It is clear that the gender pay gap it is greater in large
              teams, indicating that gender inequality might be more widespread
              in large data teams.

            <h3>Working Experience in ML</h3>
            <p>
              Many people might be also interested in the actual pay gap across
              as their career grows. In general, the median salary increases as
              years of working experience in Machine Learning increase in both
              groups. Moreover, the median salary in large teams outperforms
              that in small teams (i.e. around 10.000$ pay gap in 4 years of
              experience and 27.500$ pay gap in more than 20 years of
              experience).

        <h3>Visualisation Tools</h3>
        <p>
          Visualisation tools play a pivotal role into delivering knowledge to a
          company.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following plot explores employees' preferences in different
          visualisation tools. Both groups have almost the same preference of
          visualization tools. Moreover, it seems that Matplotlib, Seaborn
          (Python) and ggplot2 (R) are the top three visualization tools used by
          experts.

            <h3>Cloud Products</h3>
            <p>
              But what about cloud products? Below we can find the percent of
              experts who use different cloud frameworks in small and large
              teams. Overall, it seems that Google BigQuery it’s the most
              popular framework for both small and large teams (7.5%). Large
              teams show in general a greater preference to many of the cloud
              products. However, Google Cloud Dataflow and Microsoft Analysis
              Services are more popular on small teams. Finally, AWS Athena, AWS
              Kinesis and Google Cloud Pub/Sub have nearly the same popularity
              for both sizes of team.

        <h3>Percent of Large Teams in different Countries</h3>
        <p>
          The interactive map below depicts the percentage of experts who work
          in large teams across different countries. The closer it is to red,
          the higher the percentage of respondents. Readers can also get the
          actual percentage of experts by hovering over every country.

        ></div>
      </div>
      <p>
        With a more thorough look, we notice that over 60% of data specialists
        from the United States Singapore, India and some European countries work
        in large teams. On the other hand, countries such as Mexico, Thailand,
        Turkey and Austria, work mostly in small teams.

        <h3>Country Spending</h3>
        <p>
          The following comparative interactive visualisation illustrates, for
          large and small teams, the median salary in USD and the average amount
          of money spent on Cloud Services per country. The different colors of
          observations refer to countries of different region (namely North
          America, South America, Asia, Europe, Africa) Readers, when hover over
          a country, can the actual values (median salary on the left and the
          amount of money spent on the cloud service on the right). Readers can
          also use zoom get closely related countries.

          style="height:500px; width:1000px;"
        ></div>
      </div>
      <p>
        From the above comparative plot we observe that the large teams have a
        wider range of median salary and cloud service spending. On the other
        hand, the small teams have more concentrated on the salaries (most of
        them are below 40.000 USD) and the expenditure on cloud services is
        generally small. In our case, United States is the country with the
        highest median salary regardless of team size. However, the highest
        spending in cloud service spending from small-sized teams can be found
        in Israel.
