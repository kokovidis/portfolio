#Business Analytics Consulting Project/Dissertation

In the project we examine the data labelling strategies with a focus on textual data. In the second part of the project we use Weak Supervision and Data Programming to create training data without having access to previously labelled instances.

The dissertation and its repository will be available after the marking period (November 2020). Early access can be requested after demand.
